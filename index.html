	<h1> Fever 103</h1>

<p>
Pure? What does it mean?
The tongues of hell
Are dull, dull as the triple
</p>

<p>
Tongues of dull, fat Cerberus
Who wheezes at the gate. Incapable
Of licking clean
</p>

<p>
The aguey tendon, the sin, the sin.
The tinder cries.
The indelible smell
</p>

<p>
Of a snuffed candle!
Love, love, the low smokes roll
From me like Isadora’s scarves, I’m in a fright
</p>

<p>
One scarf will catch and anchor in the wheel,
Such yellow sullen smokes
Make their own element. They will not rise,
</p>

<p>
But trundle round the globe
Choking the aged and the meek,
The weak
</p>

<p>
Hothouse baby in its crib,
The ghastly orchid
Hanging its hanging garden in the air,
</p>

<p>
Devilish leopard!
Radiation turned it white
And killed it in an hour.
